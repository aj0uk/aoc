My attempts at https://adventofcode.com/2022

Plan of attack
1) write test
2) write verbose code until test passes
3) submit answer
4) refactor to reduce runtime + improve smell

Strategy
* Aim for fast exection
* Edge cases only matter if they are present in the data
* rely on unwritten rules (eg consistent input data format)
* if it fails, it fails, no need to fail gracefully

* google allowed for syntax only
* only look at others answers once correct answers submitted
